# ThePlaysTheThing
Our epic Shakespearean rendition of the game of Risk!
Wellcome!
In order to run the game, please be sure to have python 3 and pygame installed on your system. You can do this using pip.
More information on installing pygame can be found here. https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

Currently, the game needs to be run by starting with the "main_menu.py" program.

To run the game:
  - Open a command line window or terminal window to the directory with all of the game information (GameforMac, if on mac and GameforPC if on PC)
  - Run python3 main_menu.py and the game should start up!
  - You should need two computers on the same network to start the game (one to host, and another to join)
